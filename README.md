hack4us idea 
=============
Just a hack idea whilst at @hacksocnotts - the idea being the university needs student hackers like this so create an app which uses
github auth so they can share repos with the university IT dept and alert us of the awesome stuff they are doing 

The app was not finished ... turns out 4hrs whilst listening to talks for a single guy rusty in ruby is not enough who would have thought that ... 

Unfortunately not everyone in the uni keeps track of whats on hackerlegue or gets to hackdays so I thought this might be a way 
of storing info so it can be shared with the university  maybe on the IS newsletter or something :-)
